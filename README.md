# JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Description:
  
This portfolio is where I'll be showing off any cool projects or recent code I've been working on. Its is currently more of a work in progress that I intend to expand upon as my skills expand as well.
  - My motivation for this project was to learn more about problem solving. Learning to take on issues one at a time will become more and more helpful when coding future projects.
  - I built this password generator to practise responding to user-input using javascript.
  - Building this project i familiarized myself more with using prompts and confirms, as well as the spread operator.
